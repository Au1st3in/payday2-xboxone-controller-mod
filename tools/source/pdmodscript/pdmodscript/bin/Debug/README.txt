A quick little tool hacked together to make modding easier for people with large sets of changes.

You must copy "all.blb" from the assets folder of PAYDAY 2 into the same folder as the tool for this to work. I was lazy. Make sure to update it when PAYDAY 2 updates.

Usage: pdmodscript scriptfile outfile

An example script is provided to explain the syntax.
