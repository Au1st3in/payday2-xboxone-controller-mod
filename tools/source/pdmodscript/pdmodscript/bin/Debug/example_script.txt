@Name Example Mod
@Description This is my example mod. It doesn't actually do anything useful.

; Blank lines are ignored as well.
; All other lines are treated as file replacement lines.
; File lines are in the format of <original file path> <colon> <replacement file path>
; The spaces around the colon are optional, but help readability.
